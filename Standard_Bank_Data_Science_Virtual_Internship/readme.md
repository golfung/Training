# Standard Bank Data Science Virtual Internship

## What is Forage?
- Forage is an open access platform designed to unlock exciting careers for students by connecting them with our company-endorsed Virtual Work Experience Programs.

## Standard Bank

**Standard Bank** is embracing the digital transformation wave and intends to use new and exciting technologies to give their customers a complete set of services from the convenience of their mobile devices. As Africaâ€™s biggest lender by assets, the bank aims to improve the current process in which potential borrowers apply for a home loan. 

## Credit / Home Loans - AutoML vs Bespoke ML

The current process involves loan officers having to manually process home loan applications. This process takes 2 to 3 days to process upon which the applicant will receive communication on whether or not they have been granted the loan for the requested amount. To improve the process Standard Bank wants to make use of machine learning to assess the credit worthiness of an applicant by implementing a model that will predict if the potential borrower will default on his/her loan or not, and do this such that the applicant receives a response immediately after completing their application.

The data provided can be found in the Resources folder as well as (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/altruistdelhite04/loan-prediction-problem-dataset).

- train will serve as the historical dataset that the model will be trained on and,
- test will serve as unseen data we will predict on, i.e. new ('future') applicants.

## Part 1

The Home Loans Department manager wants to know the following:

- An overview of the data. (HINT: Provide the number of records, fields and their data types. Do for both).
  - 614 row x 13 columns for train dataset and 367 row x 12 for test dataset

- What data quality issues exist in both train and test? (HINT: Comment any missing values and duplicates)
  - Missing value in some rows bot no duplicated data.

- How do the the loan statuses compare? i.e. what is the distrubition of each?
  - Compare by frequency of "Y" and "N". 192 for "N" and 422 for "Y"

- How do women and men compare when it comes to defaulting on loans in the historical dataset?
  - Female comes to defaulting : 67%, Male comes to defaulting : 69%
 
- How many of the loan applicants have dependents based on the historical dataset?
  - The loan applicants have dependents are 411 applicants.

- How do the incomes of those who are employed compare to those who are self employed based on the historical dataset?
  - Average Self employed income is : 6913, Average Employed income is : 4892

- Are applicants with a credit history more likely to default than those who do not have one?
  - Applicants with a credit history more likely to default than those who do not have one.

- Is there a correlation between the applicant's income and the loan amount they applied for?
  - Correlation between the applicant's income and the loan amount : 0.55

## Part 2

Run the AutoML section and then fill in code for the traditional ML section for the the omitted cells.
